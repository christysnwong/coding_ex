Unit 14.1  - How Web Works Exercise
Part One: Solidify Terminology

What is HTTP?

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol governs how browsers and servers communicate

What is a URL?

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, which is a web address for internet resources.

What is DNS?

DNS shands for Domain Name System, this is a system that takes hostname and URLS and converts them into IP addresses.

What is a query string?

The query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL, in a specific format ?key1=value1&key2=value2...

What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?

GET - get data from the server without side effects
POST - send data to the server with side effects that may change data on server

What is an HTTP request?

An HTTP request is a request from a client to a server which follows the HTTP protocol.

What is an HTTP response?

An HTTP response is a response from a server to a client which follows the HTTP protocol.

What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.

Headers gives information about the request or the response. Here are some examples:
Request headers include hostname you’re asking about, date your browser thinks it is, language your browser wants information in, any cookies that server has sent

Response headers include content type (typically text/html for web pages), date/time the server thinks it is, type of content sending back, any cookies server wants to set, any caching information

What happens when you type a URL in a browser?

1. The browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS
2. The browser makes a get request to that IP address
3. The server sends a response with status code
4. The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc)
5. The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each
